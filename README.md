# myturn.ca.gov

### Before Using the script:

- Update Latitude and Longitude in lat/lng variables
- Update Patient Data and Eligibity Data by entering appropriate information
  - For the single-select and multi-select fields, make sure they match with the options from UI's dropdown boxes
- Update FIRST_DATE_OFFSET_HOURS (default 24) if you want to search for an appointment on the same date

A script to track vaccine availablity

The script notifies user when a vaccine is available

User might need to update vaccineData field by manually going to "inspect element" on myturn.ca.gov appointment page

The script also almost books the appointment (currently after entering one time password, there is a not_eligible error)

Kudos!

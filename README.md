# myturn.ca.gov

A script to track vaccine availablity

The script notifies user when a vaccine is available

User might need to update vaccineData field by manually going to "inspect element" on myturn.ca.gov appointment page

The script also almost books the appointment (currently after entering one time password, there is a not_eligible error)

Kudos!
